1. Core Concepts
PyQt5: Used for creating the GUI. Key components include QMainWindow, QTabWidget, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout, QPushButton, QLineEdit, QComboBox, QListWidget, and QMessageBox.

JSON: Used for storing and retrieving data (users and events).

Modular Design: The app is split into models.py (data handling) and ui.py (UI logic).

2. Data Handling
models.py: Handles loading and saving data to JSON files.

users.json: Stores user data (email and password).

events.json: Stores event data (title, date, location, type, description, image).

3. UI Design
Tabs: The app uses a tabbed interface (QTabWidget) for navigation.

Filters: Users can filter events by date, location, and type.

Modals: A modal window is used for creating new events.

Notes for Future Changes
1. UI Improvements
Clarity and Visibility:

Use larger fonts and better spacing.

Add icons to buttons for better visual cues.

Use a modern color scheme (e.g., Material Design or Fluent UI).

Adaptive Layout:

Use QGridLayout or QStackedLayout for better responsiveness.

Adjust widget sizes based on screen resolution.

2. Scalability
Database Integration:

Replace JSON files with SQLite or PostgreSQL for better performance and scalability.

Modular Code:

Keep the code modular (e.g., separate UI, data, and business logic).

Use design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) for better maintainability.

3. Additional Features
User Authentication:

Add password hashing and session management.

Event Management:

Allow users to edit or delete events.

Advanced Filters:

Add more filter options (e.g., price, category).
